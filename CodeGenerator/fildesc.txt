Could you make a fileparser in python given this file desciption:
A pxValue is any string but can not contain a quote or a newline. 

The Valuepart is either 
   a single pxValue without quotes, 
   a single pxValue with quotes or 
   a list of pxValue in quotes separated by commas and optional newlines 

Hmm DATA, HIERACRYY


A Pxfile contains 1 or more statments on the form:
Keypart=Valuepart; 
there may be whitespace after thesemicolon,
 
The Keypart consist of first a keyword then optionally a two letter language code in square-bracket then optionally a subkey in parantesis 

A subkey is a comma separated list of qutoes pxvalues 
  
keyword is one of 
STUB
SUBJECT-AREA
SUBJECT-CODE
SURVEY
SYNONYMS
TABLEID
TIMEVAL
TITLE
UNITS
UPDATE-FREQUENCY
VALUENOTE
VALUENOTEX
VALUES
VARIABLE-TYPE


I want the fileparser to feed the pxValues to setters propertis in a PxModel class. Like "pxmodel.settitle"
Please make the classes complete
